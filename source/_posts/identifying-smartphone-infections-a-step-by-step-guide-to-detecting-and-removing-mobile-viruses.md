## Yes! Phones Can Get Viruses

It is a common misconception that computers and laptops are the only devices at risk from viruses. In fact, smartphones can also be targeted by hackers and infected with viruses – especially if you regularly download apps or browse the internet on your phone.

In fact, most experts believe that smartphones are even more vulnerable to malware than computers. A major reason for this is that many people don’t take the same precautions when using their phones that they do when using a computer. 

For example, many people will download apps from sources other than the official Google Play Store and Apple App Store, which can increase the risk of getting infected with malware.
