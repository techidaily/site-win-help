## Advantages of Online Virus Scanner

Using online virus scanners offer several benefits. First, most online virus scanners are free. Some may have limited functions, but they are still useful especially if you just want to scan a particular file. Additionally, online virus scanners are always updated. Developers can add updates and upgrades to their systems without having the users download it every time.

Moreover, unlike your standard security suites on your computer, online virus scanners can utilize multiple scanners on their servers. Most, if not all, will use services from other security programs which scans your files at the same time. Some viruses and malware are smart enough to fool or even halt the operation of the installed security suite. Online virus scanners can avoid this scenario and catch well-hidden threats.

Here are some of the best online virus scanners.

## Final Thoughts

Online scanners are useful tools to ensure that your system is clean. Additionally, you can use them to examine files, URLs, and hashes. However, they cannot replace your primary security suite. These tools need a constant Internet connection. Moreover, most programs are for specific functions. That means, they are perfect as a secondary security layer and not as your lone protection.
