## What is “Search Protection”?

Search Protection is a potentially unwanted program(PUP) by Spigot Inc that pretends to help you in improving your online search results. However, in reality, it is a browser hijacker that takes control of your browser and change the default search engine, the home page, new tab redirect, and more. Search Protection redirects the user to search.yahoo.com. Search Protection is designed to protect its bundled programs and ensure that they remain installed on the system without any changes.

When the user tries to revert the settings, they get the following error message:

_Search Settings Change Notification_
_**Search Protection** has blocked an attempt by another program_ 
_to change your default search settings._

The Search Protection program interferes with online searches and other processes involving browsing online. When it is installed on your system, the SearchProtection.exe process would be running in the background. You can check that in the Windows Task Manager. Search Protection focuses on redirecting the user to affiliated pages and commercial content because such websites can generate revenue for the publisher. Browser hijacker changes various settings and preferences on web browsers so it can control where the user is redirected.

## What are the symptoms of “Search Protection” Infiltration?

Since it is a PUP, generally, the Search Protection browser hijacker application is not manually installed by users into their system. It usually infiltrates the device through the bundled program, infected sites, drive-by download, and more. 

When your system gets infected by it, it will show the following signs:

* Default search engine, the home page, new tab redirection would change to search.yahoo.com.
* While browsing, you will be redirected to irrelevant and untrustworthy websites.
* You see a lot of advertisements while browsing the internet.
* The system becomes slow and sluggish.
* Since SearchProtection.exe keeps running in the background, it would increase the RAM usage.
* CPU gets heated because of the continuous running of the application.
