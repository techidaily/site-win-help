## Unlocking Ultimate Control: A Step-by-Step Guide to Activating God Mode in Windows 11 - Benefits Revealed![ZDNet]

Accessing all the settings and options in Windows 11 can be challenging as they're spread out across a variety of categories in both the Settings app and Control Panel. An option called God Mode eases the process by providing a gateway to all the core options on one screen.

By setting up the special God Mode folder, you can view the settings for Backup and Restore, Color Management, Devices and Printers, Ease of Access, File History, Mouse, Power Options, Programs and Features, Security and Maintenance, Speech Recognition, Troubleshooting, User Accounts, and much more.

God Mode is especially useful for advanced Windows users and developers who like to manage and tweak all the nitty-gritty details of Windows. But it can also prove helpful to anyone who wants an array of commands available in one place. Since Microsoft no longer offers a Start menu shortcut for Control Panel, God Mode can be a quick and easy way to access all of its core features and applets.

The process for setting up God Mode is the same in Windows 10 and 11, but here, I'm focusing on Windows 11\. Now, let's see how this works.

## How to set up God Mode in Windows 11 

## 1\. Check your account

First, make sure you're signed into your Windows 11 PC with an account that has administrative privileges. By default, your own account should have the necessary rights. To confirm this, go to Settings, select the category for Accounts, and then check the setting for "Your Info" to make sure your account is designated as Administrator.

## 2\. Create a new folder

Next, right-click on any empty area of the Desktop. In the popup menu, move to New and select the command for Folder**.**

## 3\. Rename the new folder

Right-click on the new folder and rename it to the following string:  
 GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}

When done, press Enter.

## 4\. Launch the icon

Double-click the icon, and a window opens with all the available settings. The commands are organized by Control Panel applet, so you can browse through the various categories, including Backup and Restore, Devices and Printers, File History, Mouse, Programs and Features, Security and Maintenance, Troubleshooting, and User Accounts.

## 5\. Search for a command

Alternatively, you can search for a specific command or applet in the God Mode window. Just type the keyword or term in the Search field to view the related results.

## 7\. Create a changeable icon for God Mode

With God Mode, you can't see the icon's name or change the image. Here's another option for creating an icon with a viewable name and modifiable image.

At the window for New, choose the option for shortcut instead of folder. In the field to "Type the location of the item," enter the following string:  
 explorer shell:::{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}.

When done, click Next.

## 9\. Change the icon

To change the icon from the generic folder image, right-click on it and select Properties. Click the "Change icon" button and you can select a different icon from the explorer.exe file. You can also search for other executable files with built-in icons and choose the one you like. When done, click OK in the Properties window.
