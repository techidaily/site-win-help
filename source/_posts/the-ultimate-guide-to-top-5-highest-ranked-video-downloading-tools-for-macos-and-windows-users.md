If you google you will find tens, hundreds or even thousands of video downloaders. How can we choose the right video downloader for us among so many video downloaders?

**Now the following article will recommend the top 5 video downloaders to users with aspects on supported websites, downloading speed, downloading quality,etc.** However, even the best video downloader has its own Cons and users can find the right one for you after weighing the features and Cons of each one.
