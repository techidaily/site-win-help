## What is Facebook Malware?

Facebook malware is a type of malicious software that is designed to steal your personal information or hijack your account. It can come in the form of a virus, Trojan horse, worm, or spyware. Hackers will often use phishing techniques to trick you into clicking on a malicious link or downloading a malicious file. Once the malware is on your computer, it can spread to your friends’ computers by sending them spam messages or infecting their Facebook accounts.

Apart from that, Facebook malware can also be used to collect your personal information, such as your name, address, and credit card number. This information can then be used to steal your identity or make fraudulent charges on your account.

## How to Spot Facebook Malware?

Although there are many Facebook viruses and scams, you can easily protect yourself from them if you understand how to recognize them.

Here are the top ways the Facebook malware is spread:

### From a Message

Most of the time, Facebook malware comes in the form of a message or post from one of your friends. The message may look harmless at first, but it will usually contain a link that leads to a malicious website. Once you click on the link, the malware will be downloaded onto your computer.

### From a Fake Facebook App

Another way that Facebook malware is spread is through fake Facebook apps. These apps are usually created by hackers and are used to collect your personal information. To avoid falling for this scam, only download apps from the official Facebook app store.

### From a Third-Party Website

Hackers will also create fake websites that look like real Facebook websites. When you enter your login information on these websites, the hackers will be able to steal your password and take over your account. To avoid falling for this scam, only log in to Facebook from the official website.

### Facebook Video Virus

There have also been cases of Facebook viruses being spread through videos. The virus will usually be embedded in the video itself and will start to download onto your computer as soon as you start playing the video.

Other than that, the virus can also be spread through video links that are posted on Facebook. When you click on the link, you will be redirected to a malicious website that will download the virus onto your computer.

### From General Spam Posts

Another popular way to spread malware is by posting spam on Facebook. These posts usually contain links to malicious websites or downloads. They may also contain fake offers or deals that are designed to trick you into clicking on them. Once clicked, you will be taken to a malicious website or malware will be downloaded to your computer.

### Scan your System for Malware

The first thing you need to do is run a virus scan on your computer. This will help to identify and remove any malicious files that may be on your system. You can use a free virus scanner, such as Microsoft Defender, or a paid one, such as Norton Antivirus. Once the scan is complete, you should delete any files that are flagged as being malicious.

### Change your Facebook Password

After you have removed the malware from your computer, you should change your Facebook password. This will help to prevent the hackers from taking over your account again. To change your password, go to the “Security and Login” section of Facebook and click on the “Change Password” button.

### Uninstall Unknown Apps from the Device

If you have any apps on your device that you don’t recognize, you should uninstall them immediately. These could be apps that were installed by hackers and are being used to collect your personal information. Also, these could be apps that were installed by the malware or they could be fake Facebook apps. 

## How to Prevent Facebook Malware Attack?

Now that you know how Facebook malware is spread and how to remove it, you can take steps to prevent it from happening in the first place.

Here are a few tips:

### Install an Antivirus Program

The best way to protect your computer from malware is to install an antivirus program. This will help to identify and remove any malicious files that may be on your system. You can use a free antivirus program, such as Microsoft Defender, or a paid one, such as Norton Antivirus.

### Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Another security measure you can take is to enable two-factor authentication for your Facebook account. This will add an extra layer of security and will make it harder for hackers to gain access to your account. To enable two-factor authentication, go to the “Security and Login” section of Facebook and click on the “Edit” button next to “Two-Factor Authentication.”

### Use a Secure Browser Extension

If you use Google Chrome, you can also install a secure browser extension, such as LastPass or uBlock Origin. These extensions will help to block malicious websites and downloads, as well as keep your passwords safe.

### Keep Your Software Up-to-Date

### Install Apps from Trusted Source

When downloading apps, you should only install them from trusted sources, such as the App Store or Google Play. Avoid installing apps from unknown websites or third-party app stores, as these could be fake apps that contain malware.

### Avoid Opening Unknown Messages

If you receive a message from someone you don’t know on Facebook, don’t open it! These messages could contain links to malicious websites or attachments that will infect your computer with malware. If you think you may have opened a malicious message, you should run a virus scan on your computer as soon as possible.
