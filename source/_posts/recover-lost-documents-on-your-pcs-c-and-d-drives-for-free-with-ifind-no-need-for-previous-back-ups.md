### **Step 2:** Selection of Recovery Mode

After starting the free-to-use software, two recovery options will appear for selection: “Lost File Recovery” and “Lost Partition Recovery.” These enable you to tailor the recovery process based on whether your loss involves individual files being accidentally deleted, missing partitions that cannot be located or corrupted partitions which no longer boot properly.

### **Step 3:** Scanning for Lost Data

Once disk recovery mode is selected, iFinD uses advanced algorithms to perform an intensive scan across any targeted drive or partition in search of recoverable files – essential when uncovering data that might seem irretrievably lost. Its robust scanning abilities also play a key role here!
