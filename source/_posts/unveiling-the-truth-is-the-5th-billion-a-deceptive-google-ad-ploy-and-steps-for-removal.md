## What is “You’ve Made The 5-billionth Search”?

You’ve made the 5-billionth search. 

You were evaluated as the winner of today’s 5-billionth search query a few minutes ago by our system!

Our last winner was Brad Jenkins from Brussels, Belgium, who won a Samsung KU6179 Ultra HD TV on 14.05.2018 with his 5-billionth Search.

We are proud to announce that you are our next winner.

Every time the 5-billionth search is reached, we proclaim a winner and reset the counter.

You may choose one of three hidden prizes below. In addition, you will be entered in our Hall of Fame and receive a winner’s certificate.

Behind every blue cup is a prize. Click on a prize cup to uncover it.

For technical reasons, we are not allowed to keep your invitation open for more than 15 minutes. Choose one of the prizes below and follow the instructions on your screen.

Its main intention is to make you believe that you are the lucky one to win a prize. It will then ask you to fill a survey form to claim one of the three awards, typically: iPhone, Macbook, or Samsung Ultra HD TV. This scam aims to gather your phone number, card details, or make you subscribe to a paid service. Such type of attack is known as a phishing attack.

## What is a Phishing Scam?

A phishing scam is a social engineering attack carried out by playing with the victim’s psychology. Usually, they are meant for stealing the victim’s personal data like credit card details, ATM PIN, or net banking [password](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). 

In phishing, the users are sent or redirected to dubious links by sending them intruding advertisements, pop-ups, messages, or emails. The users are then psychologically attacked by making them believe that they are one from the many users to win a huge award.

For example, “The 5-billionth Search” is a phishing attack for identity theft.

## Why I received the “You’ve Made The 5-billionth Search” pop-up?

You have received the “You’ve Made The 5-billionth Search” pop-up or redirect because your browser or system has been infected by a malicious program like browser hijacker or adware. It may have also appeared because you have visited an infected website.

When you install any bundled software, it carries another program other than the primary one. That another application can be a malware carrier responsible for phishing attacks.

## How to Remove “You’ve Made The 5-billionth Search”?

If you are dealing with this message or pop-up repeatedly, you have to get rid of the root cause redirecting this fake message to you.

Here are the steps for that:

### **Step 1: Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and its files that try to run automatically on your system. [Follow this guide to boot your Windows 10 PC in the **Safe Mode**](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/)**.**

### **Step 2: Uninstall Suspicious Applications**

If 5th Billion Search Scam still appears on your PC, try to find the culprit application and uninstall it. 

1. Right-click on the taskbar and select the **Task Manager**.  
![Open Task Manager](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Open-Task-Manger.png)
2. Watch out for the applications that are consuming the system memory even though you did not install or launch them.
3. Right-click on the suspicious application and open its file location.  
![uninstall suspicous files](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uninstall-suspicous-files.png)
4. Delete the file from its root location.
5. Open Control Panel and click on **Uninstall a program** and check for suspicious apps. One by one, select and uninstall them.![uninstall the apps](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uninstall-the-apps.png)

### **Step 3: Delete Temporary Files**

The temporary files folder can also be a carrier of malicious files. Thus, we recommend deleting all the temporary files and folders regularly for the smooth running of the system. Removing the temporary files would also clear the unnecessary clutter from your system and free-up the valuable space.

Here are the steps to eliminate thre temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
3. This run command would navigate you to this path: **_C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp,_** that is, the temp folder.
4. Select all Files and Folders of this folder and delete them. Don’t hesitate to delete them, as they are not essential for any of your tasks. ![Delete temp files](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Delete-temp-files.png)
5. Next right-click on the **Recycle Bin** and select **Empty Recycle Bin.**![Empty recycle bin](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Empty-recycle-bin.jpg)

### **Step 4: Reset Web Browser Settings**

If your browser is misbehaving because of 5th Billion Search Scam, then reset its settings to default.

1. Open Chrome and navigate to **Settings** by clicking on the three-dots at the top right.![Chrome Settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chrome-Malware-Scanner-1.png)
2. Click on advanced **Advanced**.![Chrome Advanced Settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrome-Malware-Scanner-2.png)
3. Under **Reset and cleanup,** click on “**Restore settings to their original defaults.”**![Restore chrome](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Restore-chrome.png)
4. Select **Reset settings** on the next prompt.![reset the chrome](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/reset-the-chrome.png)
5. Relaunch your browser.

### **Step 5: Install an Antimalware and Perform a Scan**
