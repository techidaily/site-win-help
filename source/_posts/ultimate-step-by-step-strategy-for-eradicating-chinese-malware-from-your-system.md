## What is Chinese Malware?

Chinese malware is a type of ransomware that targets computers running the Windows operating system. This malware is typically spread through email attachments or malicious websites. Once it infects a computer, it will encrypt files and demand a ransom be paid in order to decrypt them.

This malware is particularly difficult to remove because it uses strong encryption that can not be easily broken. Additionally, the malware will delete any backups that you have of your files, making it even more difficult to recover your data.

This dangerous file-encoding malware locks the targeted files, including videos, audios, photos, PDFs, and documents, and appends the “**_.China_**” extension to the names of all of them. It does this by using an extremely potent encryption method. After that, you won’t be able to access the data without decryption software.

After successfully encrypting your files, China Ransomware drops a ransom note titled “**_ÁªÏµÎÒ,ÇëÎðÉ¾³ý1582698030694.txt_**”. It instructs you to contact the attackers via the email address listed in the note. The hackers demand a ransom payment to obtain the decryption key and unlock the encrypted files. Although it is not specified in the text file, the ransom could be between $200 to $1500 and must be paid in Bitcoins or another kind of digital money.

## Should You Pay The Ransom?

Paying the ransom is not recommended as there is no guarantee that you will get your files back. Additionally, by paying the ransom, you are supporting the continued development of this malware.

The best course of action is to remove the malware from your computer and then attempt to recover your data from a backup.

## How does Chinese Malware Spread?

This ransomware is usually spread through email attachments or malicious websites. The email attachment will often masquerade as a benign file, such as an invoice or order confirmation. When the file is opened, it will download and install the malware on your computer.

Malicious websites are another common way that this malware is spread. These websites may look like legitimate websites, but they will actually download and install the malware on your computer if you visit them.

## How to Remove Chinese Malware?

Removing Chinese malware can be a challenge, but it is possible. We recommend that you follow the steps below to remove this malware from your computer.
