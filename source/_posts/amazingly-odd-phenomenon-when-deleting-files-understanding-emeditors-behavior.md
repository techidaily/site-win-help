## Amazingly Odd Phenomenon When Deleting Files - Understanding EmEditor's Behavior

Yes. It happened again (I’m still looking at it as I write this). This always seems to happen very late at night (now, it’s 2:38 am). An interesting thing is that  
 I opened a fresh EmEditor while the misbehaving EmEditor window is still there, side-by-side (as Microsoft says “sxs” :-)

 It is quite interesting that grabbing a text file from somewhere (usually originates at a display of TotalCommander — one of my favorite tools, but I also tried to grab a file in Windows explorer display for the same result) and then drag it over the newly opened EmEditor’s area that shows “drop-accepted” cursor and then continue fly over to the older EmEditor’s area and the cursor changes to the “drop-disallowed” shape. It reminds me of an airliner fly over a friendly country that welcomes you and then go over a hostile airspace that does not cooperate.

 Furthermore, there is another interesting aspect of this.

 It seems there are three types of area in EmEditor’s display area.

 1) Top area (TitleBar, MenuBar, Toolbar and the tabarea)  
 2) Projects pane (I usually keep it at the left hand side)  
 3) The main text-editing area

 When I drag a file over a good EmEditor display,  
 The mouse cursor always remains the “drop-accepted” shape and I can drop it at Area 1 and Area 3 that starts the editing session. But, when drop it in Area 2, depending on where to drop, it behaves differently (according to the rule that governs the Projects pane behavior which is OK).

 Now, when I try the same thing over a misbehaving Emeditor’s display area, The top section (Area 1) shows the “drop-accepted” image — but when I drop the file there, nothing seems to happen without any error message (a black hole). Then, of course, Area 2 and Area 3 of misbehaving EmEditor give me the “drop-disallowed” cursor and obviously, nothing happens when I drop it. That is, whether the mouse cursor shows drop-accepted or drop-disaallowed, the effects are the same — no discernible action takes place.

 Anyway, right now, I’m looking at a total of four EmEditor displays. Two of them are “misbehaviing” with the “drop-disallowed” cursor display. I sometimes open with the “-sp” switch and sometimes without. When I open a new instance of EmEditor, the new one seem to behave well.  
 …Wait. I just found something different. The problem seems to have gone while I was experimenting (as I have been wriing this report (inside the Forum section here).  
 Now, all of the EmEditor displays behaves well and I don’t have any of them that gives the “drop-disallowed” cursor.  
 So, my experiment tonight ends right now. (It’s 3:32 am and I’m going to bed — strange things happen to old men at very late night). Very spooky.

 One more thing: Tonight, I did not play with the Project pane very much. I was mostly doing my own work (a lot of activities with several tabs open and a few separate EmEditor displays all over the two-monitor configurations— I always need more desktop!!!

 Good night…
